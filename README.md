# Project-Create-Gallery-with-pure-

This code snippet showcases a simple gallery layout created using only HTML and CSS. The gallery features a grid layout with responsive card elements, each containing an image.

The HTML structure consists of a <section> element with the class gallery, containing multiple <article> elements, each representing a card. Inside each card, there's a <figure> element containing an <img> tag displaying a preview image.

CSS is used to style the gallery layout. The background class sets the background color, while the gallery class creates a flexbox layout with wrapped items, forming a grid-like structure. Each card is styled with rounded corners, a shadow effect, and a transition for hover effects.

Hovering over a card increases its size and applies a bold font weight, creating an interactive hover effect. Additionally, the cards are set to have a cursor pointer to indicate interactivity.

This gallery provides a clean and visually appealing way to display images, with smooth hover effects for enhanced user experience.
